* THIS REPOSITORY IS ALWAYS REBASED ON TOP OF THE ORIGINAL SOURCE TREE *
* BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU PULL IT INSTEAD OF CLONE IT                      *

This is an unofficial port of Internet DJ Console to Python3 and Gtk3 using python-gi.
This port is fully functional although considered in alpha stage.
The main branch of this port is NOT intended to diverge from the original application,
with the exception of the language version and UI framework version. This means:

    * if you want to merge new features from the original source code just notify
    it without sending patches, since the main branch is always rebased on top
    of the original source code

    * if you have enhancements and feature requests, please contact the original
    author (http://idjc.sourceforge.net)

    * if you discover issues in this port that alter the original intended behaviour of the
    application, feel free to submit patches

    * if you want to propose enhancements on the python3/gtk3 UI codebase that doesn't alter
    the original intended behaviour, feel free to submit patches

Internet DJ Console README.

A full set of documentation for this particular version can be
found in the doc directory of the source tree and possibly installed
in /usr/share/doc/idjc.../ in HTML format. Look for index.html.

The documentation on the project homepage at
http://idjc.sourceforge.net relates to the most recently released
source code tarball. It's advice may not be relevant to the version
you are trying to use.

If you obtained this code from the git repository the doc directory
won't exist yet. Please run the bootstrap script to re-create the
build environment and doc directory which is where to look for
further build instructions.

Before making IDJC itself you should install libshout-idjc from the
subdirectory of the git sources or separate download for the
released version. This probably only ever needs to be done once.
